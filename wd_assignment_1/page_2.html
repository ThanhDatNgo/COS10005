<p>I lived in Do Son District, which lay on the outskirts of Hai Phong, a famous costal city in Vietnam. This place was once a famous destination for summer holiday because of the long coastline with a variety of fresh, scrumptious seafoods that made their marks in visitorsâ€™ minds. However, due to the opening of other tourist attractions, Do Son has lost its place and is being forgotten. However, I enjoy the tranquility of the town as well as the kindness and hospitality the residents have. The annual Do Son Buffalo Fighting Festival still attracts a good number of visitors every now and then. In my heart, Do Son, Hai Phong will always remain one of the most attractive and historical places.
